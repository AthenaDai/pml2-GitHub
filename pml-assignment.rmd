This is an R Markdown documentprepared for course project assignment of Coursera Practical Machine Learning Nov 2015 session. 

Step1: Load the required packages
```{r}
library(caret)
library(randomForest)
library(ggplot2)
```
Step2: Read required data from the corresponding URLs
```{r}
training<-"http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
testing<-"http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"
training<-read.csv(training,na.strings=c("NA",""))
testing<-read.csv(testing,na.strings=c("NA",""))
```
Step3: Obtain list of variables and # of observations
```{r}
dim(training)
names(training)
```
Step4: remove variables that seems to be date stamp etc
```{r}
training<-training[,8:160]
testing<-testing[,8:160]
```
Step5: remove variables that contains too much NAs and reduce # of predictors to smaller and higher-quality set.
```{r}
nonNA<-apply(!is.na(training),2,sum)>19621
training<-training[,nonNA]
testing<-testing[,nonNA]
dim(training)
```
Step6: take a smaller(i.e., 30%) sample for model training and use seed to ensure reproducibility
```{r}
inTrain<-createDataPartition(y=training$classe,p=0.3, list=FALSE)
dtraining<-training[inTrain,]
```
Step7: Decide to build a random forest model since RF is known to be the most accurate machine learning algo along with boosting. with 50+ predictors in this modeling problem, picking RF also plays to the strength of this approach. 5-fold Cross-validation used to run RF model. As shown in the output, mtry=27 generated the best cross-validation accuracy i.e., ~0.98 therefore used. 
```{r}
rfModel<-train(classe ~ .,method="rf",data=dtraining,trControl=trainControl(method="cv",number=5),prox=TRUE,allowParallel=TRUE)
print(rfModel)
```
Step8: print out the top preditors based on the model
```{r}
varImp(rfModel)
```
Step9: use the rf model above to generate prediction for the testing data. I used the pml_write_files function to parse the preditions into 20 text files saved under the working directory. After submitting the answers to the coure website, I got 20/20 accuracy, indicating an out-of-sample accuracy of 100%.   
```{r}
answer<-predict(rfModel,newdata=testing)
pml_write_files = function(x){
  n = length(x)
  for(i in 1:n){
    filename = paste0("problem_id_",i,".txt")
    write.table(x[i],file=filename,quote=FALSE,row.names=FALSE,col.names=FALSE)
  }
}
pml_write_files(answer)
```
